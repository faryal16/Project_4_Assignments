# Online Class Projects

This repository contains various Python projects organized into two main categories: **Basic** and **Intermediate**. Each category contains multiple problems or games designed to improve your Python skills in different areas such as control flow, lists and dictionaries, and more.

## Folders Overview

### 1. Basic
The **basic** folder contains beginner-level Python scripts focused on various simple problems.

- **joke_bot.py**: A simple joke bot that responds with a joke when the user types "Joke" and displays a "Sorry I only tell jokes" message for anything else.
- **double_it.py**: A program that takes a number as input, doubles it, and repeats this process until the number reaches 100 or greater.
- **liftoff.py**: A countdown program that starts at 10 and goes down to 1 before printing "Liftoff!".
- **guess_a_number.py**: A game where the user guesses a randomly generated number, receiving feedback whether their guess is too high or too low until they guess correctly.
- **random_number.py**: A program that prints 10 random numbers between 1 and 100, using Python’s `random` library.

### 2. Intermediate
The **intermediate** folder contains more complex problems and games that involve concepts such as control flow, lists, and dictionaries.

#### a. ControlFlow
- **high_low_game.py**: A game where the user guesses whether their number is higher or lower than the computer’s randomly chosen number. The score is tracked and displayed at the end of each round.

#### b. Intro to Python
- **planetary_weight_calculator.py**: A program that calculates the equivalent weight of a person on various planets in the solar system based on the user’s weight on Earth. It uses different gravity constants for each planet.

#### c. Lists and Dicts
- **update_list.py**: A problem where you practice updating elements of a list.
- **indexing_game.py**: A problem where you practice accessing, modifying, and slicing elements in a list. The user interacts with the program by choosing operations such as accessing, modifying, or slicing the list.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```

2. Navigate to the folder containing the Python script you want to run.

3. Run the desired script using Python:
    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```
